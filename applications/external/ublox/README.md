# ublox
Flipper Zero app to read from a u-blox GPS over I2C. This app can
display data, log a path to a KML file, and sync the Flipper's time to
GPS time. Get the app and see more info on the Flipper app hub!

This app used to reside in my "flipped" GitHub repository, but I made
it much better and moved it here.
